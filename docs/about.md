# User gaze tracking web application

This web application enables gaze and mouse tracking for users by leveraging the [WebGazer.js](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/) library [[1]](#citation). It allows the configuration of various prototypes or images to be displayed to the user, making it a versatile tool for usability testing and research. Additionally, it records user interaction data in an SQL database, providing a robust platform for analyzing user behavior.
